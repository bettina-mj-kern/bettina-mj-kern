ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Bettina, a pre-doc researcher and data enthusiast in Vienna.

During my Master's in psychological research I discovered my love for R, and I'm trying to hone and improve my skills by participating in TidyTuesday from time to time. 

Currently I'm researching student dropout in tertiary education and started learning Python.
