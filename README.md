ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Bettina, a researcher and data enthusiast based in Vienna.

During my Master's in psychological research I discovered my love for R, and I'm trying to hone and improve my skills by participating in TidyTuesday whenever I can. 
You're welcome to look around and check out the data visualisations. It takes time to build a repo, so please be understanding that this is a work in progress. The repo will grow over time and feature more diverse pieces of code and visualisation.

If there is something you would like to know about the code or if there are improvements you'd like to suggest, I cordially invite you to open an issue here on github to let me know!
