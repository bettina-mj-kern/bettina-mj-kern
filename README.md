ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Bettina, a researcher and data enthusiast based in Vienna.

During my Master's in psychological research I discovered my love for R, and I'm trying to hone and improve my skills by participating in TidyTuesday whenever I can. 
You're welcome to have look around and check out the data visualisations. It takes time to build a repo, so please understand that this is a work in progress, and the repo will grow over time and feature more diverse pieces of code and visualisation.

If there is something you would like to know about the code or of there are improvements you'd like to suggest, I warmly invite you to open an issue here on github to let me know! 
I'm happy to get someone else's expertise on my code.
